# interactive_matlab_plot

The goal of this code is to facilitate interactive viewing of Matlab plots.

This code currently depends on Jim's Matlab Standard Library, but this dependency should be removed soon.

Functionality:

- line-dragging to simultaneously enlarge one plot area while shrinking others
- mouse movements to the left of axes to facilitate data zooming and panning
- scroll bar (in progress)

Future Functionality:

- buttons for x and y zooming of data
- support for roi selection and plotting
- support for signal averaging of selected signals to plot in new window

JAH TODO: Add pictures - preferably gifs
